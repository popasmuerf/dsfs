"Data! Data! Data!" he cried imapatiently.  "I can't make brick without clay."

The Ascendance of Data
==========================================================

We live in a world that is drowning in Data.
Websites track every user's every click.
Your smartphone is building up a record of your locatin
and speed every second of every day.

"Quantified selfers" wear pedometers-on-steroids that are ever recording
their heart rates. 

Movement habits, diet, and sleep patterns.  Smart cars
collect driving habits, smart homes collect living habits, and smart
marketers collect purchasing habits.  The INternet itself represents
a huge graph of knowledge that contains (among other things) an
enormous cross-reference encyclopedia; domain-specific databases about
movies, music, sports results, pinball machines, memes, and cocktails' 
and too many government statistics(some of them nearly true!!) from too many
governments to wrap your head around.

Buried in these data are answers to countless questions that no
one is ever thought to ask.  In this book, we will learn how to find
them.


What is data science ?
===============================================================
There's a joke that says data  scientist is someone who 
knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer
science than a statistician.

In fact, some data scientists are.....for all practical purposes.....
are statisticians, while others are pretty much
indistinguishable from software engineers....some are machine-learning experts,
while others coun't machine-learn their way out of a paper-bag.

Some are PhDs with impressive published wroks....while others haven't at 
any point read an academic paper(shame on them, though)....in short,
practitioners for whom the definition is totally, abosolutely wrong.

Data scientist...in general...build predictive models out of data.  That's what
they do.


Common means by which we build predictive models...
==========================================================
-Networks
-Training
